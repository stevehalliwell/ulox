# ULox

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/stevehalliwell/ulox/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/stevehalliwell/ulox?branch=main) [![Tests](https://github.com/stevehalliwell/ulox/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stevehalliwell/ulox/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A scripting language and language playground, in C#, in Unity.

Originally a grew out of the [lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) implementation, I was playing around with, [here](https://github.com/stevehalliwell/ulox-work). It was so engaging, I wanted to keep using and growing the language.

If you want to know more about the language itself, the tests are the best way right now. They're in the ulox.core.tests project in the ulox folder.
