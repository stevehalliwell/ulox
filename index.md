## ulox
An experimental scripting language and language design space. Targeting game scripting in Unity.

### Status

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/stevehalliwell/ulox/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/stevehalliwell/ulox?branch=main) [![Tests](https://github.com/stevehalliwell/ulox/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stevehalliwell/ulox/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

ulox is still quite early, expect breaking changes often. Use issues and PRs on github to track the current and future work.

### Goal
Create a code base that makes it quick and simple to experiment with scripting language design. I don't know exactly what I want a scripting language for games to be, but I'll know it when I see it. So we want to make that easy to explore and discover.
